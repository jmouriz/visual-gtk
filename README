Visual GTK+
-----------

A Glade plugin to include a hack of Christian Hergert GtkBuilderScript and enable edit JavaScript.

From the original README:

GtkBuilder + Inline JavaScript

This is a quick hack to allow writing javascript inside of a GtkBuilder xml
file and attaching signals to said javascript functions.

GScriptJs is an object that can be created from within the GtkBuilder file.
The "script" property is used to eval javascript into the JSContext.

Use a connect callback similar to connect_func in script.c.

Cheers, and Happy Hacking,
